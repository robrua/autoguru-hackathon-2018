  "Can we apply for a production api key with a partially completed project? I'm making an application that I plan to open to the public, and it is partially complete at this stage. However, I'd like to add data such as how many games a user has played a specific champion for in the current season, and other such data that would require me to hit the match api for each match that the user has played this season. This number would likely be in the hundreds, possibly thousands, which is much too high for a development api key and would take too long to test efficiently. Could I show my partially completed project to the reviewers and indicate what future plans I have for the project? And then use the production API key to implement these features that would require many more endpoint hits?": "You can find seed data for matches at these urls;\nhttps://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/riot-developer-portal/seed-data/matches1.json\n...\nhttps://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/riot-developer-portal/seed-data/matches10.json",
