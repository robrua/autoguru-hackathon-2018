You may be experiencing HTTP 429 responses from the API, have been blacklisted, or are wondering about strategies to utilize your API Key more efficiently.\n\nThe Riot API requires that users limit their requests to sensible limits to avoid undue tax on the API infrastructure, and to force developers to adhere to best practices like caching API responses where possible.\n\nIf you're running into issues with getting too many HTTP 429 errors, make sure you double check your rate limiting strategy so don't get blacklisted!\n\nIf you're not rate limiting at all now, consider using a 3rd party community library to access the API instead.\n\nIf you think your rate limits aren't high enough, feel free to add an app note on your application describing why you want a higher limit. Rioters will view the note and determine whether to increase your API key.\n\n\n__**429 (Rate Limit Exceeded)**__\nThis error indicates that the application has exhausted its maximum number of allotted API calls allowed for a given duration. If the client receives a Rate Limit Exceeded response the client should process this response and halt future API calls for the duration, in seconds, indicated by the `Retry-After` header. **Applications that are in violation of this policy may have their access disabled to preserve the integrity of the API.** Please refer to our Rate Limiting documentation (https://developer.riotgames.com/rate-limiting.html) for more information on determining if you have been rate limited and how to avoid it.\n\n**Common Reasons:**\nUnregulated API calls. Check your API Call Graphs to monitor your Dev and Production API key activity.\n\nhttps://developer.riotgames.com/response-codes.html","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"count":{"__ndarray__":"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","dtype":"float64","shape":[110]},"index":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109],"quest":["429","Rate Limits","How do I implement rate limiting in python?","How do I implement rate limiting in javascript?","Blacklist","How can I limit the number of requests I'm making to the API using nodejs?","Help!

However, I'd like to add data such as how many games a user has played a specific champion for in the current season, and other such data that would require me to hit the match api for each match that the user has played this season. This number would likely be in the hundreds, possibly thousands, which is much too high for a development api key and would take too long to test efficiently.
